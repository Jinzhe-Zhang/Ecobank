# Ecobank

This is the project which I helped my senior graduate student finish in 2017. 

The program came in ninth in the citi cup in November of that year. At that time, I was mainly responsible for calling the API of Amap（高德地图）, recommending stores and displaying application interfaces according to user preferences and user locations.
